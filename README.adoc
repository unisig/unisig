## Overview

Unisig is a uniform signature scheme for binary file formats and
network protocols. It offers the following benefits:

* Clearly differentiates binary data from text and detects typical
file transfer errors.

* Uses a human-readable and future-proof naming scheme based on URIs,
and an alternative naming scheme based on UUIDs.

* Lets file format identification tools show the name of a format with
no extra work on the format designer's part.

## Motivation

Each binary format normally has its own _signature_, also known as a
_magic number_. The signature is a constant byte string meant to
identify the format and distinguish it from other formats. It is
normally situated right at the start of data so the format can be
identified as early as possible. The following table dissects the
signatures of some popular formats.

|====

Back in the eighties, disk space was scarce and designers preferred
compact formats. There were also fewer file formats and fewer file
transfers across different operating systems so magic number
collisions were not a problem. Hence formats often had only a 2-byte
magic number. As 32-bit computers gained market share, 4-byte magic
numbers became popular.

The success of the personal computer and the internet has exacerbated
problems with file formats. Software distribution is no longer limited
to tightly-knit communities gathered around particular organizations
or computer platforms. Instead, anyone can write software and publish
it instantly to the entire world. Computer platforms and operating
systems are no longer walled gardens: files are routinely exchanged
between different systems. File format designers do not necessarily
communicate with other designers, with platform vendors, or with user
communities. Additionally, a format can achieve sudden popularity and
spread all over the world in a matter of months or even weeks.

To answer these problems, we need:

* *More collision resistance.* There are now many more formats, so
  signatures must be longer.

* *A way for mutually unknown parties to avoid collisions.* Must work
  without a central registry.

* *Discoverability.* Format specifications should be discoverable. Web
  links are best.

* *Extensibility.* It is prudent to assume that any new format lasts
  for decades. A signature scheme should be extensible to cope with
  unforeseen requirements so the same scheme can be used indefinitely.

* *Dating.* Signatures should state the when the format was published.
  This is good for collision resistance, and is useful information for
  computer archaeologists and explorers of all stripes.

* *Error detection.* With a greater variety of computer systems,
  incorrect file transfers are more likely. A well-chosen magic number
  can double as an error detector.

Unisig solves the problems as follows:

* The signature contains either a UUID (universally unique identifier)
  or a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). UUIDs have been designed
  specifically for collision resistance and safe use by mutually
  unknown parties. URIs are easily collision resistant if one uses a
  DNS hostname and includes a date in the URI, and everybody knows how
  to use DNS-based URIs.

* Web URIs are possibly the most discoverable general-purpose tokens.

* URI syntax itself is infinitely extensible by registering new URI
  schemes. URI schemes are well-known in the internet community and a
  registration procedure is already in place.

* For error detection, we gratefully stole the thoughtful magic number
  of the PNG image file format and modified it to suit. In particular,
  we had the benefit of hindsight to make it more resistant against
  misidentification as Unicode text.

## Specification

### Usage

Unisig is not its own file format or network protocol. It is intended
for use as a building block in other formats.

A format will normally position a Unisig at the very beginning of the
data stream. However, this is not required.

It is possible to have more than one Unisig in one data stream, should
that serve a purpose. A format containing data in other formats can
have a Unisig in a nested format.

### File name extension

Unisig does not have its own file name extension. Each format using
Unisig should choose its own extension (if any).

Unisig can identify the format of extensionless binary files.

### MIME type

Unisig does not have its own MIME type. Each format using Unisig
should have its own MIME type.

MIME types of the form `foo/x-bar` can be used informally.

For a popular format, please

with IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).

### Structure of a Unisig

Unisig comes in two variants:

* URI-based (7 magic bytes + 1 length byte + variable-length URI)
* UUID-based (7 magic bytes + 1 length byte + 16-byte UUID)

### Magic bytes

A Unisig starts with the following seven hex bytes: DC DC 0D 0A 1A 0A
00.

The bytes serve as a unique magic number to identify Unisig. However,
they also double as protection against bad file transfers that corrupt
data. The bytes have been chosen for the following purposes.

* DC DC

  ** These two bytes start an invalid Unicode surrogate pair when
     interpreted as UTF-16 or UTF-32 (either big-endian or
     little-endian). They also represent an invalid encoding of a
     UTF-8 character. These signals serve as an early warning that the
     format is not Unicode text.

  ** Neither byte represents an ASCII character, further reducing the
     likelihood that the format is misread as text.

  ** Both bytes have the most significant bit set. Some old file
     transfer methods are not _8-bit clean_ -- they only keep the
     low-order 7 bits of each byte. These bytes will be corrupted by
     such a transfer, serving as an early warning that the rest of the
     data is most likely corrupted as well.

  ** The bytes distinguish Unisig to old software tools that use the
     first two bytes of a file to identify the file format.

* 0D 0A

  ** These two bytes represent a newline in CR LF encoding
     (carriage-return followed by line-feed). That encoding is used in
     text files on Windows, and in many text-based internet protocols.
     Some file transfer methods (most notably the FTP protocol) can
     automatically convert newlines in text files from one encoding to
     another. Unfortunately, file transfer programs can misidentify
     binary files as text and wrongly apply newline conversion to
     them, corrupting their contents. Having a CR LF newline among the
     magic bytes detects mistaken conversion of CR LF to LF.

* 1A

  ** This byte represents the version number of the Unisig standard in use.
     It is the ASCII character Control-Z (`^Z`), and was
     chosen for historical reasons: it stops file display under MS-DOS.

  ** Unlike some ASCII control characters, `^Z` is not used to encode
     whitespace (tab, newline, etc.). Non-whitespace control
     characters serve no purpose in text files. Hence this byte serves
     as another hint that the format is binary.  Future versions should
     make use of other similar control characters.

  ** This byte is unrelated to newline encoding, so it also acts as a
     separator between the previous CR LF and the upcoming LF newline.

* 0A

  ** This byte represents a newline in LF encoding (line-feed only).
     That encoding is used in text files on Unix-like operating
     systems. Having a LF newline among the magic bytes detects
     mistaken conversion of LF to CR LF.

* 00

  ** This is a null byte (all bits zero). It detects bad transfers
     that drop or alter null bytes.

When the magic bytes are broken down into 2-byte or 4-byte words, some
of those words are asymmetrical. Hence inadvertent 16-bit and 32-bit
byte-order swaps are also detected.

### Length byte

The seven magic bytes are followed immediately by one length byte. It
is interpreted as an unsigned integer (0..255).

If the value is non-zero, a URI signature string with that many bytes
follows. The string is not null-terminated.

If the value is zero, a 16-byte UUID signature follows.

### URI signature

A URI signature may not contain more than 255 bytes.
All bytes must be ASCII graphic characters. If the
domain contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded
using Punycode.

Two signatures are equal if they are the same length and all byte values
are equal. In other words, equality comparison is based on the raw
bytes, not their text interpretation.

The signature must be a valid URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).  It should
point at an existing resource, ideally a web page, at the time the format is
published. Hopefully the resource will continue to exist for decades to
come. Then people who encounter
the signature can open the page in a web browser to find
information about the format.

If the URI scheme is `http://` it must be omitted.  This saves
space and does not interfere with usability.
Later versions of this specification may be
amended to recommend a new default in case another protocol replaces
HTTP as the most popular transport for web pages. Our intention is
that the default scheme remain a natural choice for linking to web
pages. Omitting the URI scheme makes web addresses shorter, easier to
read, and permits a smooth upgrade path as the web switches to new
protocols in the coming years and decades.

#### Dates

The URI must contain a fragment in the format yyyy-mm-dd representing a
date the version of the format was published.
On that date the domain name must have been controlled by
the person or organization defining the format. Domains do change hands
(but not more than once a day), so a date is required for uniqueness.
It is very unlikely that
multiple format versions will be published in a single day, so there
is no provision for time of day.

A date in the above format is a valid HTTP URL
fragment (`#2019-04-02`) and HTML anchor (`<h2 id="2019-04-02">`). This way, the
address can link to a web page explaining several versions of the
format and the date can make the link jump directly to the right
section of the page. These URLs look so clean that we recommend them
even for formats with only one version.

#### Example URIs

### UUID signature

UUID (also known as GUID) is a standard format for 128-bit (16-byte)
partially random numbers. It is designed to minimize the chance of
collision even when numbers are generated by mutually unknown parties.
UUID stands for _universally unique identifier_, and GUID stands for
_globally unique identifier_.

The UUID must be in version 4 or 5
of the standard format. It is written as raw binary bytes with no
delimiters. The byte order depends on which version of UUID is used.
Some versions are big-endian; others mix big-endian and little-endian
subfields.

(Versions 1 and 2 have privacy concerns, as they leak MAC addresses.
Version 3 relies on the broken MD5 hash function.)

UUID signatures are well suited for two situations:

* Space-constrained environments (e.g. microcontrollers or individual
  network packets).

* Applications where the identity of the format or its designer should
  remain private.

### Padding for alignment

Individual formats may specify that a given number of null bytes be
appended to a Unisig. This will ensure that the data after the
signature is aligned at an _n_-byte boundary.

A UUID Unisig always has a constant length of 24 bytes. That means the
data after the signature is automatically 2-byte, 4-byte, 8-byte, and
12-byte aligned. Eight null bytes can be appended to make it 16-byte
aligned.

### Caveat

Old Corel Draw color palette files are known to share the two initial
bytes DC DC. Their file name extension is `.cpl`.

## Implementation

### Specific

If you are only looking to read or write one particular signature, it
is simplest to skip all generic Unisig handling. It is enough to
hardcode the raw bytes of the signature, including the Unisig magic
bytes, as one byte vector in your program. When reading data, you can
read that many bytes and then use ordinary byte string comparison to
check that the signature you read was the one you expected. Example in
C:

----
// Unisig: example.com/format#2020
static const unsigned char sig[31] = {
    0xdc, 0xdc, 0x0d, 0x0a, 0x1a, 0x0a, 0x00, 0x17, 0x65, 0x78, 0x61,
    0x6d, 0x70, 0x6c, 0x65, 0x2e, 0x63, 0x6f, 0x6d, 0x2f, 0x66, 0x6f,
    0x72, 0x6d, 0x61, 0x74, 0x23, 0x32, 0x30, 0x32, 0x30,
};

int read_valid_sig(FILE *input)
{
    unsigned char buf[sizeof(sig)];
    if (fread(buf, 1, sizeof(sig), input) != sizeof(sig))
        return 0;
    return memcmp(buf, sig, sizeof(sig)) == 0;
}
----

### Generic

To read any Unisig, first read 8 bytes to get the magic and the length
byte. Then, if the magic is correct,
check the length byte and read that many more bytes.
Example in C:

----
static char *read_unisig(FILE *input, int *out_is_uuid)
{
    static const unsigned char magic[7]
        = { 0xdc, 0xdc, 0x0d, 0x0a, 0x1a, 0x0a, 0x00 };
    unsigned char head[sizeof(magic) + 1];
    char *sig;
    size_t len;
    int is_uuid;

    if (fread(head, 1, sizeof(head), input) != sizeof(head))
        return 0;
    if (memcmp(head, magic, sizeof(magic)))
        return 0;
    len = head[sizeof(magic)];
    *out_is_uuid = is_uuid = (len == 0);
    if (is_uuid)
        len = 16;
    sig = calloc(len + 1, 1);
    if (sig == NULL)
        goto fail; // Out of memory
    if (fread(sig, 1, len, input) != len)
        goto fail; // Read error or truncated file
    if (!is_uuid) {
        if (memchr(sig, '\0', len))
            goto fail; // Sig contains null byte, not usable as a C string.
    }
    return sig;
fail:
    free(sig);
    return NULL;
}

### Patterns for the unix `file` utility

The following magic patterns let the file(1) command detect Unisig
files.

For versions of file(1) supporting `pstring` and `guid` tests:

----
0      string    \xDC\xDC\x0D\x0A\x1A\x0A\x00  Unisig:
>7     ubyte     =0                            UUID
>>8    guid      x                             %s
>7     ubyte     >0                            URI
>>7    pstring   x                             %s
----

For versions of file(1) supporting `pstring` but not `guid` tests:

----
0      string    \xDC\xDC\x0D\x0A\x1A\x0A\x00  Unisig:
>7     ubyte     =0                            UUID
>>8    ubelong   x                             %08x
>>12   ubeshort  x                             \b-%04x
>>14   ubeshort  x                             \b-%04x
>>16   ubeshort  x                             \b-%04x
>>18   ubelong   x                             \b-%08x
>>22   ubeshort  x                             \b%04x
>7     ubyte     >0                            URI
>>7    pstring   x                             %s
